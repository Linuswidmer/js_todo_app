#Javascript Todo Application

## Introduction
With this small project I am taking a dive into the world of Javascript, Bootstrap and React!
My goal is to create a Todo list application both in vanilla Javascript and then with React to learn.
This is a great opportunity to learn how React is built/interacts upon Javascript and prepare for my next project at 42.
